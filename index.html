        <h1> Introduction        </h1>
        <p>I am a Peruvian native that recently graduated with a degree in psychology. I was recently living in Miami but am now dividing my time between Charlotte and San Francisco. While doing psychology I was very interested in human factors psychology and human-computer interaction. This, in addition to working with tech-obsessed children, has led me to realize that what I really want to do is work in EdTech.</p>

        <h1> Where I'm From        </h1>
        <p>The short answer is I'm from everywhere. I was born in Germany but both my parents are Peruvian. Even though I have lived very shortly in Peru I still lay claim to being 100% Peruvian and take much pride in my heritage. Growing up I was an army brat and have lived in many cities across the US. However, something about the excruciating heat, torrential rains, and incessant mosquitoes in Miami appealed to my mom and we decided to stay and live there permanently. </p>

        <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <h2>What's important to you?</h2>
        <p>Learning. I used to believe I had too many passions. I even became afraid that not being able to commit to one passion was detrimental to my future. I've now realized that learning is my passion and therefore I want to learn as much as possible. </p>
        <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
        <p>By far my favorite hobby is belly dancing. There is nothing more relaxing to me than putting on some music and just dancing and nothing more rewarding than finally nailing a choreography. </p>
        <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
        <p>Kanaku y El Tigre. It's a Peruvian indie pop band that I just fell in love with when my close friend introduced me to them. I also listen to Spanish big names like Shakira, Juanes and Carlos Vives (as well as more show tunes than I'd like to admit). </p>
