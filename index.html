        <h1> Introduction        </h1>
        <p>I am a Peruvian native that recently graduated with a degree in psychology. I was recently living in Miami but am now divinding my time between Charlotte or San Francisco. While doing psychology I was very interested in human factors psyhcology and human computer interaction. This, in addition to working with tech obsessed children, has led me to realize that what I really want to do is work in EdTech.</p>

        <h1> Where I'm From        </h1>
        <p> The short answer is I'm from everywhere. I was born in Germany but both my parents are Peruvian. Eventhough I have lived very shortly in Peru I still lay claim to being 100% Peruvian and take much pride in my herritage. Growing up I was an army brat and have lived in many cities across the US. However, something about the excruciating heat, torrential rains, and incessant mosqitoes in Miami appealed to my mom and we decided to stay and live there for over a decade. </p>
